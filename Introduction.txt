Benefits of NodeJS:

Performance: V8 engine and non-blocking I/O make it very fast and efficient.

Scalability: Easily handles a large number of concurrent connections.

Full-Stack JavaScript: Developers can use JavaScript for both the front-end and back-end, which reduces context switching and improves development speed.

Large Ecosystem: NPM provides a vast collection of libraries and tools.

Community: A large and active community provides support, resources, and open-source contributions.

Real-time Capabilities: Excellent for building real-time applications.

Easy to Learn: If you already know JavaScript, the learning curve for Node.js is relatively gentle.

• Cost-Effective: Can often reduce infrastructure costs due to its efficient resource utilization

ExpressJS Introduction

Express JS: Express.js is a fast, minimal, and flexible web framework for Node.js that simplifies building web applications and APIs in a more structured and organized way

What is web framework?

Web frameworks are sets of pre-written code and libraries that provide a foundation for developing software applications.

• Reusability
• Standardization
• Testing & debugging support
• Community and support

Type of Frameworks

1.Opinionated Framework

Has a defined architecture (MVC, MVVM, etc.).

• Ruby on Rails (Ruby)

• Django (Python)

• Spring Boot (Java)

• Laravel (PHP)

2.Unopinionated Framework

No strict rules or predefined workflow.

• Express.js (Node.js)

• Flask (Python)
